# Local Development

Everything you need to develop, test, and verify changes locally without
ever touching your real Gmail inbox. The test account — referenced
throughout this doc as `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL`, the env var set in
`.env.local` and `~/src/mail-app/.env` — is the only inbox dev/tests
interact with. The literal address is not committed anywhere in this
repo; it lives only in your local `.env*` files.

## Quick start (fresh worktree)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Copy env files from the main worktree
cp /Users/ankit/src/mail-app/.env .          # build-time OAuth client + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
cp .env.local.example .env.local             # local-only test creds

# 3. Fill in .env.local
#    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — required for evals, agentic-verify, pre-pr
#    EXOEMAILTEST_CLIENT_ID + _SECRET — copy from .env
#       (drop the MAIN_VITE_GOOGLE_ prefix)
#    EXOEMAILTEST_REFRESH_TOKEN — get via the seed script (next step)

# 4. Seed the test inbox (one-time OAuth + insert 19 fixtures)
node scripts/seed-test-inbox.mjs

# 5. Prime .dev-data/ so the app boots already signed in as the test
#    account (no setup wizard, no manual OAuth in the app UI)
node scripts/setup-dev-data.mjs

# 6. Launch dev
npm run dev
```

After step 6, the app comes up signed in as `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL`
and syncs the 19 seeded fixture emails. You're developing against
real Gmail-shaped data, never your personal inbox.

## How the credential layout works

| File | What it holds | Who reads it | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.env` | Build-time Google OAuth client (`MAIN_VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_*`) + optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `electron-vite` at build time | The main worktree, copied per checkout |
| `.env.local` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EXOEMAILTEST_*` (client id/secret + refresh token) | Eval / spike / seed / agentic-verify scripts | Per-worktree, never committed |
| `.dev-data/credentials.json` | OAuth client id/secret in the format the app expects | Electron at runtime | Written by `scripts/setup-dev-data.mjs` |
| `.dev-data/tokens.json` | OAuth tokens (access + refresh) for the default account | Electron at runtime | Written by `scripts/setup-dev-data.mjs` |
| `.dev-data/data/exo.db` | SQLite — accounts, emails, drafts, analyses | Electron at runtime | Populated by sync on first dev run |

`.dev-data/` is gitignored. Every worktree starts empty and rebuilds
from the OAuth refresh token in `.env.local`.

`.env.local` is gitignored. The repo never sees the test account's
refresh token. CI never sees Anthropic or Gmail credentials.

## What does what

### The dev environment

| Command | What it does | When you run it |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Launches Electron in dev mode against `.dev-data/`. Signs in as `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL` if tokens are present. | Day-to-day development. |
| `npm run dev:demo` | Launches in demo mode — mock data, no real Gmail, no API calls. | Quickly poking at UI without OAuth setup. |
| `node scripts/setup-dev-data.mjs` | Refreshes the OAuth tokens in `.dev-data/` from `.env.local` and writes credentials.json. Idempotent. | When `.dev-data/` is missing tokens, or after a token revoke/refresh. |
| `node scripts/seed-test-inbox.mjs` | Inserts 19 fixture emails into the test Gmail inbox via `users.messages.insert`. Idempotent (skips if already seeded). | First-time setup. After a Gmail wipe. Or `--reset` to re-seed cleanly. |

### Local-only AI-aware checks

These all need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`. They cost real
money (~cents per run). Never CI.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run pre-pr` | Run before opening a PR. Full eval suite + agentic verification of the diff + optional real-Gmail. Aggregates results into `.pre-pr-report.md` and injects them into the PR body. ~15 min. |
| `npm run pre-pr -- --quick` | Same but only evals affected by the diff. Agentic-verify still runs. Skips real-gmail. ~3-5 min. |
| `npm run pre-pr -- --full-sync` | Default + the real-Gmail full-sync test. Run when touching sync / OAuth / PrefetchService. |
| `npm run pre-pr -- --no-inject` | Run everything but don't touch the PR body. Useful for dry-runs. |
| `npm run eval` | Analyzer eval against committed baseline. |
| `npm run eval:features -- --feature <name>` | Run one feature eval. Features: `draft-generator`, `calendaring-agent`, `archive-ready-analyzer` (so far). |
| `npm run eval:features -- --all` | All feature evals. Reports TODO list of remaining features. |
| `npm run eval:features -- --feature <name> --update-baseline` | Capture this run's scores as the new baseline. Use after intentionally improving a prompt. |
| `npm run agentic-verify` | Launch Electron + run the diff-scoped agentic verification driver. Standalone (also runs as part of `pre-pr`). |
| `npm run agentic-explore` | Open-ended exploration mode — agent wanders the app looking for anomalies. ~$2/run. Run weekly or after big changes. |

### Hermetic checks (also run in CI)

These don't need any secrets and are fast.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Full Playwright suite — unit + e2e (demo mode) + integration. |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit tests only. ~5s. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | E2E tests against the dev build in demo mode. |
| `npx playwright test --project=migrations` | Migration replay + schema symmetry. ~1s. |
| `npx playwright test --project=agentic` | Pure-logic tests for agentic-verify helpers. ~500ms. |
| `npm run test:bench` | Performance benchmarks with budget assertions. ~5s. |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | Typecheck. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint. |
| `npm run format:check` | Prettier dry-run. |

### Real-Gmail tests (local only)

```bash
# 9a — Tests against cached .dev-data/ (no fresh sync). Fast.
EXO_REAL_GMAIL_TEST=true npx playwright test --project=real-gmail

# 9b — Full sync from empty. Slow. Run when touching sync code.
EXO_REAL_GMAIL_TEST=true npx playwright test --project=real-gmail-full-sync
```

Both require `EXOEMAILTEST_*` creds in `.env.local`. Both target
`$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL` only.

### Packaged-app smoke

Catches PATH / native-module / asar bugs that dev never sees.

```bash
npm run build
npm run pack
# On macOS:
EXO_PACKAGED_BINARY="dist/mac-arm64/Exo.app/Contents/MacOS/Exo" \
  npx playwright test --project=packaged
# On Linux (also what CI does):
EXO_PACKAGED_BINARY="dist/linux-unpacked/exo" \
  npx playwright test --project=packaged
```

### Soak test

Long-running memory growth detector. Default 60 min, configurable:

```bash
# Quick sanity (5 min):
EXO_SOAK_DURATION_MS=300000 EXO_SOAK_INTERVAL_MS=30000 \
  npx playwright test --project=soak

# Full run:
npx playwright test --project=soak
```

## OAuth troubleshooting

The seed script and `setup-dev-data.mjs` both use the **loopback OAuth
flow** (`http://localhost:3847/oauth2callback`) — same as the main app.
Google deprecated the older OOB flow (`urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`) in
October 2022; any script using it will fail with `invalid_request`.

### "Port 3847 already in use"

The Exo app is running. Quit it, then re-run the script.

### "Google didn't return a refresh_token"

You've consented to this OAuth client with the test account before.
Google only returns a refresh token on FIRST consent.

Fix:
1. Visit https://myaccount.google.com/permissions (signed in as
   `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL`)
2. Find and revoke the Exo app
3. Re-run `node scripts/seed-test-inbox.mjs`

### "Access blocked: this app's request is invalid"

The test account isn't on the OAuth consent screen's test-users list.

Fix:
1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
2. Pick the project that owns your app's OAuth client
3. Test users → Add users → `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL`

### "Access token expired" / sync failures

Run `node scripts/setup-dev-data.mjs` to refresh.

## Eval workflow

### Adding a new fixture to an existing feature

1. Create `tests/evals/feature-fixtures/<feature>/<id>.json` matching
   the shape (see `feature-fixtures/README.md`).
2. Run `npm run eval:features -- --feature <feature>` to see the
   initial score.
3. Iterate on the rubric until the score is stable.
4. Run with `--update-baseline` to lock it in.

### Adding a new feature

1. Create `tests/evals/features/<feature>.ts` exporting
   `async function runXxxFixture(input: unknown, fixtureId: string): Promise<string>`.
   The string is what the judge grades.
2. Register it in `tests/evals/feature-evals.ts` under `FEATURES`.
3. Create starter fixtures in `feature-fixtures/<feature>/`.
4. Run `--update-baseline` once to capture initial scores.
5. Remove from `TODO_FEATURES` in `feature-evals.ts`.

The data-dir module lazy-loads electron now (May 2026 refactor), so
new feature modules don't need any per-service surgery — they just
work outside Electron context under `tsx`.

## Agentic verification

### Interactive (Claude in this session)

If Claude is helping you build a feature, it can verify the result
itself via the `electron-devtools-testing` skill. Use it.

### Scripted (pre-PR)

`scripts/agentic-verify.mjs` is the scripted equivalent. Two modes:

- `--mode=verify-diff` — agent reads `git diff origin/main..HEAD`,
  generates a verification plan, drives the running app via the
  `chrome-devtools` MCP, captures anomalies. 40 actions, $0.50,
  10-min cap.
- `--mode=explore` — open-ended. 100 actions, $2, 10-min cap.

Output goes to `scripts/.agentic-runs/<timestamp>-<mode>.{log,md,json}`.

The agent is sandboxed: only the chrome-devtools MCP is exposed, no
file or shell access.

## Pre-PR gate

`npm run pre-pr` is the local gate that lives between you and merge.
It runs every LLM-dependent check and injects a marker block into the
PR body via `gh pr edit`:

```html
<!-- PRE-PR-REPORT-START SHA=<sha> mode=<full|quick|full-sync> -->
... aggregated report ...
<!-- PRE-PR-REPORT-END -->
```

The CI job `verify-prepr-report` checks the marker:
- Marker absent → fail (run pre-pr at least once on the PR).
- `mode=quick` → fail (final report must be from a full run; quick
  skips real-Gmail).
- Verdict != PASS → fail.
- Otherwise → pass.

The marker `SHA=` is informational only — it's NOT gated against HEAD.
One passing full run per PR is sufficient; iterate freely with
`--quick` and switch to full before requesting review or merging.

No Anthropic key, no Gmail token, no third-party API key ever lives
in CI.

## Project-wide invariants

- **Dev signs in as `$EXOEMAILTEST_EMAIL` only.** Never your real
  inbox. Years of personal email is not a development surface.
- **No LLM or Gmail credentials in CI.** Anything that calls Claude
  runs locally. Anything that touches Gmail runs locally.
- **`.dev-data/` is the test account's state.** Wiping it is safe;
  just re-run `setup-dev-data.mjs` to rebuild from the refresh token.
- **`.pre-pr-report.md` is gitignored.** It's a local artifact; the
  PR body holds the authoritative version once injected.

section captures every architectural decision and tradeoff with the
reasoning, in case you ever wonder "why did we do it this way?".
