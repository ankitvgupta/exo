Great discussion in today's Q4 planning meeting! I have a few follow-up items that need your input:

1. Budget allocation for the new initiative - can you review the attached spreadsheet and let me know your thoughts?
2. Team assignments - we need to finalize who will lead each workstream
3. Key milestones - please confirm the dates work for your team

Can we schedule a quick call tomorrow to finalize these items?

Best,
Michael`,

Quick question - we're integrating with your API and running into some rate limiting issues. What's the best way to handle this for batch operations?

We're seeing 429 errors when we try to make more than 100 requests per minute. Is there a way to increase our limit, or should we implement exponential backoff?

Thanks for any guidance!

Thanks for reaching out. Here's a quick update:

1. We're about 80% complete on the main deliverables

Happy to jump on a call if you need more details.

I've reviewed the budget proposal and have a few thoughts:

- The infrastructure costs look reasonable
- I'd suggest increasing the contingency buffer to 15%
- Let me know if you need additional justification for the headcount request

Let's discuss tomorrow.
